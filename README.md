### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Fabien, a French developer passionate about web technologies since 1998, when I started with PHP after studying Sciencesâ€”especially fluid mechanics :man_scientist:.

After 27 years, I still approach software development with the same enthusiasm :technologist:.
These days, I mostly write in :elephant: PHP and :snake: Python, but I also enjoy exploring :crab: Rust and ğŸ¦« Go.
While I can work with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, my true affinity lies with backend development and software architecture âœ¨.

- ğŸ”­ Currently working on open source projects and backend tools.
- ğŸŒ± Continuously learning new languages and paradigms, especially Rust and Go.
- ğŸ‘¯ Open to collaborating on innovative backend projects.
- ğŸ’¬ Happy to discuss backend, architecture, or best development practices.
- ğŸ“« Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabien-dosse/) or here on GitHub.
