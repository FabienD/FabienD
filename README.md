### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a French developer who started web development in 1998 with PHP after learning Sciences and especially fluid mechanics.

After 25 years, I still do this job with the same passion. I still write in PHP, Javascript and Python, but for a while I like to write in Rust. Even though I can write Javascript and CSS code, I must admit that I have more affinity for backend stuff.
