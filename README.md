### Hi there 👋

I'm Fabien, a French developer passionate about web technologies since 1998, when I started with PHP after studying Sciences—especially fluid mechanics :man_scientist:.

After 28 years, I still approach software development with the same enthusiasm :technologist:.
These days, I mostly write in :elephant: PHP and :snake: Python, but I also enjoy exploring :crab: Rust.
While I can work with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, my true affinity lies with backend development and software architecture ✨.

- 🔭 Currently working on open source projects and backend tools.
- 🌱 Continuously learning new languages and paradigms, especially Rust.
- 👯 Open to collaborating on innovative backend projects.
- 💬 Happy to discuss backend, architecture, or best development practices.
- 📫 Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabien-dosse/) or here on GitHub.
