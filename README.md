### Hi there 👋

I am a French developer who started web development in 1998 with PHP after :man_scientist: learning Sciences and especially fluid mechanics.

After 25 years, I still do this job with the same passion :technologist:. I still write in :elephant: PHP or :snake: Python, but for a while I enjoy writing in :crab: Rust and 🦫 Go. 
Even though I can write TypeScript, HTML and CSS code, I must admit that I have more ✨affinity for backend stuff✨.
