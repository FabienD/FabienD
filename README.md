# Hey, I'm Fabien 👋

Backend developer with a scientific background (fluid mechanics) who's been building for the web since 1998. I bring the same analytical rigor to software architecture that I once applied to Navier-Stokes equations.

**What I do:** Clean Architecture, Hexagonal patterns, and robust backend systems.  
**Main stack:** PHP, Python — currently deep into Rust/Axum.  
**Infrastructure:** GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, PostgreSQL.

🔭 Currently working on backend tools and exploring Rust for production systems  
🦀 Learning: Pushing my Rust skills further every day  
💬 Let's talk: Backend architecture, DDD, or why Rust is worth the learning curve
