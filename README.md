### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a French developer who started web development in 1998 with PHP after :man_scientist: learning Sciences and especially fluid mechanics.

After 25 years, I still do this job with the same passion :technologist:. I still write in :elephant: PHP, TypeScript and :snake: Python, but for a while I like to write in :crab: Rust. Even though I can write TypeScript, HTML and CSS code, I must admit that I have more affinity for backend stuff.
